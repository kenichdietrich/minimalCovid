# minimalCovid19 Shiny dashboard

This repository contains source files of a data dashboard developed in Shiny R. It is a minimal implementation to visualize data from Covid-19 worldwide.

The data are obtained from the repository made by Johns Hopkins University and CSSE (available [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)) and are updated every day, so the app is able to show the latest data.

An app demo is available at [minimalCovid](https://kenidie.shinyapps.io/minimalCovid/), but it is frozen at day 2020-09-29.
